# Heart-Disease-Prediction

This project aims to develop a machine learning model that predicts the likelihood of a person having heart disease based on various health parameters. The model uses a dataset of medical records that includes information such as age, sex, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other factors that have been linked to heart disease.
